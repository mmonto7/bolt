# bolt

> An opinionated meta config runner for react components, doing the heavy lifting so you don't have to.

Bolt makes creating new react component libraries easy.

It provides tasks for different phases of a component library development cycle, such as:

- `dev` and `hot` - the ability to
- `lint` - Run `eslint` on `demo`, `src`, `test`
- `test` - Run tests in `test/client/`
- `build` - Generate an npm package

## Install

To get the most out of `bolt`, install the command line tool:
```
$ npm install bolt-cli -g
```

This will allow you to directly run `bolt` from the command line, instead of having to put it behind `scripts` in your `package.json`.

within a react component library, run:

```sh
$ npm install bolt --save
```

1. in your `package.json`, replace existing scripts with `bolt <task>` where the task is the name of the task being replaced. For instance: `"cov-frontend": "istanbul check-coverage 'coverage/client/*/coverage.json'"` would be replaced with `"cov-frontend": "bolt cov-frontend"`.
1. Enjoy seamless integration with pre-existing configs for your opininated `react` component!

**If you're using `bolt-cli` (`npm install bolt-cli -g`), run `bolt` within your package to see the scripts that are available to you.**

## Usage

Running `npm run <task>` will run the appropriate bolt task that's in your `package.json`.

## Unique Configuration

So you don't want to use a `bolt` command out of the box? No problem!

You can override a command in _your_ `package.json` and run `bolt <cmd>` and `bolt` will opt for your script over the script it provides.

For example, say you run:

```
$ bolt clean-dist
```

`bolt` will run `rimraf` on your `dist` directory. If you wanted it to do something else such as echo "I love electricity!", you can put the following script in your `scripts` object:

```
"scripts": {
  "clean-dist": "echo 'I love electricity!'"
  ...
}
```

Now when you run `bolt clean-dist`, rather than it running `rimraf dist`, it will echo "I love electricity!".

## Why?

Going through and modifying `*.config*` files in _every_ react component library you have (which correlates 1:1 to a git repository) is a huge pain in the butt, it's a lot of copy/pasta and no one should 1) have to do that and 2) have to endure the possible degradation over time of human copy/pasta.

This package tries to solve the problem of creating a "meta-monolith" that stands behind our components so people can just build cool stuff and not worry about all the config that goes into keeping a component up to date.

Maybe one day it won't be opinionated. But this day? Not this day.
